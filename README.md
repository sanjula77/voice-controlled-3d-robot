# 🤖 Talking Lexi - 3D AI Assistant

A production-ready 3D AI Assistant with voice input/output capabilities, built with React, Three.js, and Web Speech API.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Real-time speech recognition
- 🔊 **Voice Output**: Natural text-to-speech responses
- 🧠 **AI Brain**: Multi-model fallback with DeepSeek V3.1, Mistral, Gemini, Llama, and Qwen
- 🤖 **3D Robot**: Interactive 3D character with animations
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Dark/Light theme support
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- ⚡ **Fast**: Optimized 60fps 3D rendering

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup AI Brain (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Get a free API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API key: `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173`
   - Click "🚀 Click to Start Lexi" to initialize audio
   - Enter your OpenRouter API key when prompted (or skip for basic mode)
   - Start talking with Lexi!

## 🧠 Multi-Model AI Fallback

Lexi uses a sophisticated multi-model fallback system for maximum reliability:

1. **Primary Model**: DeepSeek V3.1 (fastest, most capable)
2. **Fallback Chain**: Mistral → Gemini → Llama → Qwen
3. **Smart Retry**: If one model fails, automatically tries the next
4. **Real-time Feedback**: See which model responded in the debug panel
5. **15s Timeout**: Per-model timeout prevents hanging

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **99.9% Uptime**: Multiple models ensure responses
- ⚡ **Fast Response**: Primary model usually responds in <2s
- 🔄 **Automatic Fallback**: Seamless switching if models are down
- 📊 **Debug Info**: Toggle debug panel to see model performance

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Initialize**: Click the "Start Lexi" button to activate audio
2. **Talk**: Click the microphone button and speak
3. **Listen**: Lexi will respond with voice and animations
4. **Explore**: Use mouse/touch to rotate and zoom the 3D scene
